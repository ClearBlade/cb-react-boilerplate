# ClearBlade React Boilerplate

Welcome to the ClearBlade React boilerplate project! This repository demonstrates a few common use cases of interacting with the ClearBlade platform via React app and the ClearBlade [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/clearblade/JavaScript-API). You can develop the app locally with Create React App and when you're ready, build and push the app to a ClearBlade portal.

## Use cases

Here's a list of the current use cases that the app covers

- Fetch collection
- Live message chat over websockets

## Todo

Here's a list of use cases that we'd like to demonstrate in the future

- Custom login screen
- Updating collections

## Usage

- git clone the repository
- `npm install`
- run the local development server with `npm start`
- Build the app for the portal with `npm run build:portal -portal=app`
- Push the app to the portal with `cb-cli push -portal=app`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
